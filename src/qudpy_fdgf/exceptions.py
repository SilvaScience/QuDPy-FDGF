"""Public exception hierarchy for QuDPy-FDGF.

Each exception identifies a distinct failure boundary: invalid external model
contracts, unsupported capabilities, unavailable experimental features, or
failed iterative convergence. Callers can catch ``SolverV10Error`` for a
single package-level error boundary.
